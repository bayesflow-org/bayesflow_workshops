# 🧠 BayesFlow Workshop Materials

Welcome to the official repository for **BayesFlow workshop materials**!  
This repo contains hands-on resources and code examples designed to help you learn and apply modern Bayesian inference techniques using the **[BayesFlow](https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow)** library.

---

## 📚 Overview

Modern Bayesian inference combines computational tools for estimating, validating, and drawing conclusions from probabilistic models.

In recent years, a new class of **simulation-based inference (SBI)** methods has emerged as a powerful approach for scaling Bayesian inference to **complex models** and **large datasets**. These materials guide you through the foundations and applications of these methods using the BayesFlow library.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **one folder per workshop**, each containing self-contained materials:


- Each `workshop_x` folder contains:
  - 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive code examples and exercises  
  - 📁 **Data**: Supporting datasets (if any)  
  - 📄 **README**: Brief instructions and learning goals for the specific workshop
